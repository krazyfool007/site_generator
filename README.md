# site_generator

This is a site generator program I've written for the boot.dev guided project.

This is the most extensive, complicated and involved coding project i've ever managed. If you compare it to my other repository, bookbot, you can see the increase in complexity.

I'm hoping this repository is a symptom and testiment to being able to motivate myself to learn new things even at the old age of 30. 

Special thanks goes out to my 10x AI programming friend boots who made for an amazing sounding board when I was trying to make sense of the newer concepts or iron out any misunderstandings I had.
